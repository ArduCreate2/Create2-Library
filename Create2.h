/// \mainpage Create2 library for Arduino
/// 
/// This is the Arduino Create2 Library
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for communicating with the iRobot Create 2 robot
/// through a serial port.
/// The Roomba is the original device from iRobot.
/// The Create 2 is a new version of the iRobot Create, which is a platform for hobbyists. It has a
/// serial port DIN socket underneath the plastic cover on the top of the robot. 
/// 
/// The Create 2 uses a set of commands supported by this library. 
/// 
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// <a href="Create2.zip"><b>here</b></a>.
/// 
/// This library has been tested using an Arduino Mega 2560.
/// 
/// The following example programs have been included to demonstrate how functions from the Create2 Library can be used.
/// 
/// \li <B>BasicSetup:</B> Demonstrates the general layout of code we used to control the Create 2
/// \li <B>Sensors:</B> Shows how sensor packets are retrieved from the Create 2
/// \li <B>SongAndClean:</B> Demo of how to to achieve output from the Create 2
/// \li <B>Recharge:</B> Gives an example of using sensor packets to make decisions
///
/// \par Open Interface
/// The iRobot Open Interface (OI) for the Create 2 defines communication with the Create 2.
/// A copy of the OI can be found <a href="Create_2_OI.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.
/// 
/// \par Installation
/// To install this library, unzip the downloaded zip file and place the directory it contains into
/// the libraries folder of your sketchbook.

/// \class Create2 Create2.h <Create2.h>
/// \brief Support for the iRobot Create 2 via serial port using the iRobot Open Interface (OI) protocol.
/// 
/// The iRobot Create 2 platform supports a serial port through which one can communicate with the robot.
/// The protocol implemented here conforms to the Open Interface protocol described in the iRobot Open
/// Interface Command Reference. This can be found <a href="Create_2_OI.pdf"><b>here</b></a>.
/// 
/// The Create 2 is equipped with a mini-DIN serial port socket.
/// 
/// In order to communicate with a Create 2, you must create an instance of the Create2 class and then call its
/// instance methods to send commands and receive sensor messages. You can also request sensor data to be 
/// retrieved from the Create 2.
/// 
/// \par Electrical Considerations
///
/// The serial port output TXD from the Roomba/Create is too weak to drive the RX serial port input 
/// of an Arduino properly.
/// This is because of the USB-Serial converter on the Arduino: it also tries to drive the RX serial port input
/// via a pullup resistor, 
/// but the Roomba does not have enough drive to pull the RX down below about 2.5 volts, which is insufficient 
/// to be reliably detected as a TTL serial input of 0.
///
/// \note Note that this problem does not affect the Serial1 Serial2 or Serial3 ports on the Mega: these ports do not 
/// have other circuitry connected to them and the Roomba can drive the serial port inputs of these ports 
/// without a problem. Its only the RX Serial port (ie the first Serial port) that is affected by this problem. 
///
/// What this means is that if you intend to connect a Roomba to the standard (first) RX/TX serial port on an Arduino 
/// you \a MUST have additional circuitry to help drive RX on the Arduino low enough. 
///
