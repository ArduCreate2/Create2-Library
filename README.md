# Create2-Library
Arduino Library for communicating with the iRobot Create 2.

Our names are Ducnan Lilley and Susan Tuvell.
While taking an undergraduate robotics course at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, we interfaced Arduino microcontrollers with
the iRobot Create 2 for a project. As the Create 2 had recently been released, there were no preexisting Arduino libraries to
work with. Instead of just working with Mike McCauley's library for the original iRobot Create
(http://airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/Roomba/), we decided to build upon his library and create our own, which covers all of the
changes found in the Create 2. 

A more detailed description of our library, along with the associated API and download links for the library and the Create 2
Open Interface, can be found at http://math.hws.edu/Create2Library/.

To install this library for use with Arduino, the unzipped folder will need to be renamed "Create2". Then, follow the official
Arduino instructions for installing a library found here: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/Libraries.
